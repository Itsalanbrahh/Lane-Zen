### Next.js Configuration Issues

If you encounter warnings about invalid Next.js configuration options, remove the swcMinify option from next.config.js or downgrade to Next.js 13.x.

### Missing npm Scripts

If you see errors like 'Missing script: dev' when trying to run commands from the project root, make sure to navigate to the frontend directory first:

```bash
cd Lane\ Zen/freight-forecast-app/frontend
npm run dev
```
